# Movie_Library_Database-JavaScript-
A site where a database is entered for movies according to the user's choice and desire.
At the beginning of the page there is an ADD MOVIE button, on the top right
The button opens a new screen with three different options:
Movie Title: The user must enter the name of the movie he chooses.
Image URL: The user must insert a link to an image from the Internet that is related to the movie the parent selected.
Your Rating: The user must rate the movie as he sees fit (the website allows you to choose a rating between 1-5 and an error message will be thrown if he does not do so).
When finished, the user can choose two buttons: ADD or CANCEL.

After his selection, the user will see the movie he chose on the home page screen and the image in an adjusted size next to it and the rating he gave, just like in a movie library.
